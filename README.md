# Oxidation Number Quiz

A simple Python script to test your knowledge of the oxidation numbers of elements. The script uses a dictionary to store the oxidation numbers of each element. The user is asked to provide the oxidation numbers of a randomly selected element, and the script verifies the answer and provides feedback. The user can keep practicing until they feel confident with all the oxidation numbers in the dictionary.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Input the oxidation numbers for the randomly selected element.
4. The script will give you feedback on whether your answer is correct or not.
5. Keep practicing until you feel confident with all the oxidation numbers in the dictionary.

## Note
*Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
*The script uses the random module, which is part of the Python standard library, so there is no need to install any additional packages.

## Statistics
The script keeps track of the total number of questions asked, the number of correct answers, and the number of incorrect answers. The statistics are displayed after each question.
